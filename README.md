# Fishing-Ontario
The purpose of this project is to collect data from Fishing Ontario and plot all the data into google maps so that we can use it as a tool which can assist us to locate our desired fishing places with its relevant information. 

The idea was inspired by our team member Steven, and the project was completed by three people who are Ben, Steven, and Sandy.

We used a package from python which is called Selenium to extract the data from Fishing Ontario website and we used two packages which are gmaps and googlemaps for our data visualization
